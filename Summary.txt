Q1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
A1. The knowledge point is about iterator in java. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html

Q2. Why the test failed at first?
A2. Because the default output is not the expected test result, some are null and some are empty

Q3. Why you corrected the test that way?
A3.
[CollectionsTest]
createList: Simply add the next element in iterator to list
should_predict_linked_list_operation_result():
1. iterator.next() ==> "Amy" ^ "Bob"  "Carl"
2. iterator.add("Juliet") ==>  "Amy" "Juliet" ^ "Bob"  "Carl"
3. iterator.previous() ==> Return Juliet && "Amy" ^ "Juliet" "Bob"  "Carl"
4. iterator.remove() ==> "Amy" "Bob"  "Carl" (Because Removes from the list the last element that was returned by next() or previous())
should_reflects_back_to_original_list_for_sub_range(): determine the reseult after performing subList

[ArrayTest]
Easy implementation for pop and push, ensureCapacity by storing the original array to temp and enlarge the original array, put back after enlarged

[DistinctIterator]
reference and learn from eclipse original Distinct iterator
https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/eclipse-collections/src/main/java/org/eclipse/collections/impl/lazy/iterator/DistinctIterator.java

[SequenceIterator]
Simply implemented next, hasNext and use a for loop to add the sequence to my arraylist


Q4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
A4. No.
